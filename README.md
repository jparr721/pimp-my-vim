# Pimp My Vim
A lot of people have asked me how I do my setup. Since I am tired of teaching everyone here is a not-so-simple bash script to automate the process so you can pretend to be a vim wizard too!

## Running
`chmod +x pimpmyvim.sh`

`./pimpmyvim.sh`

### Notes
This code has not been tested because of finals, if it breaks your configs, do not get mad at me
